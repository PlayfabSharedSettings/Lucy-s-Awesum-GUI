# Public-Beta > LAGM < V1.1

------------------------------------------------------

LAGM - Lucy's Awesum GUI Mod
        - its my awesome GUI mod that gives you many QOL (Quality Of Life) features to boost your play, and whenever you don't have your VR headset enabled on steam VR, it automatically turns on WASD + Looking Around With Mouse movement :D (ACTUAL CHEATS LIKE               PLATFORMS + MORE COMING VERY VERY SOON.)

------------------------------------------------------

This mod:

Adds my awesum GUI
Adds an easy WASD and mouse looking around movement system for non-vr users of users who dont wanna play on vr.

------------------------------------------------------

- reminder this IS a public beta, so it wont be the best, although I have been working on this for that past day making it IMO the best I possibly could in     just 1 day. 

- if you have any suggestions you want me to make/add, directly dm me them on discord

------------------------------------------------------

The GUI has:

- Main Tab
    - You can Join, Leave lobbies, Change your name/color directly from the GUI (fully customize-able)

- Lobby Players Tab
    - Displays Information about every user in your lobby
    - Displays ID
    - Displays Custom Data
    - Displays "Cool" cosmetics (Finger-Painter, Illustrator, Admin Badge, Stick, Fire-Stick e.c.t.)
    - Displays if they are a "Cool" user (anyone on a public list on my github repo)

- Misc Tab
    - Literally just lets you select theme/colors of the GUI

------------------------------------------------------

(the GUI backgrounds/colors arent the best, as this is one of my first times using any forms of GUI, nevermind ImGUI in a gorilla tag mod.)
